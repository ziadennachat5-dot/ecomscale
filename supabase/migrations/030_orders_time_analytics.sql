-- Migration: ensure immutable order_received_at and provide SQL helpers
-- Idempotent: drops functions if they exist and re-creates them

-- 1) Add order_received_at if missing, defaulting to created_at when available
ALTER TABLE IF EXISTS public.orders
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS order_received_at timestamptz DEFAULT (created_at);

-- 2) Ensure existing NULLs are populated with created_at when possible
<<<<<<< HEAD
UPDATE public.orders SET order_received_at = created_at WHERE order_received_at IS NULL AND created_at IS NOT NULL;

EXCEPTION WHEN others THEN
